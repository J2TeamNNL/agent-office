## Analysis Framework

### 1. Factual Accuracy

- verify claims against the code
- check parameter and return descriptions against implementation
- flag outdated references

### 2. Completeness

- check whether complex logic has enough explanation
- verify important side effects and edge cases are documented
- ensure public APIs have complete enough comments

### 3. Long-Term Value

- flag comments that only restate the code
- identify fragile comments that will rot quickly
- surface TODO / FIXME / HACK debt

### 4. Misleading Elements

- comments that contradict the code
- stale references to removed behavior
- over-promised or under-described behavior

## Output Format

Provide advisory findings grouped by severity:

- `Inaccurate`
- `Stale`
- `Incomplete`
- `Low-value`
